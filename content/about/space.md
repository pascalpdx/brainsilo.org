## Current Space

BrainSilo is currently renting a small industrial space near downtown.

This space is great for anyone doing smaller projects - arts and crafts, jewelry, software or hardware design or anyone working on a computer or who doesn't require a lot of space to work.

It's 850sq. ft., in an L shape, with about 16' ceilings, and has a dock-loading height garage door.

## Future Space

We're in the process of an effort to rent a larger fabrication facility that will serve the needs of members that want to do metalwork and other large/messy forms of art.
