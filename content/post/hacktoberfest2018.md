What is Hacktoberfest? 

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of open source software run by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) in partnership with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/). 

* Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community! 

* Five quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories. 

* You can sign up any time between October 1 and October 31. 

* Pull Requests from before you officially register still count. 

* The first 50,000 completions of 5 pull requests will be awarded a free (shipping included) t-shirt at the end of October.

PASCAL’s site repository lives here: https://github.com/pascalpdx/ It is open. 
Feel free to participate in Hacktoberfest at PASCAL by submitting a pull request (PR) to our site housed on Github.

We will have a project for Hacktoberfest in the project’s tab: https://www.pascalpdx.org/project/ 
Submit whatever you’d like and let it be immortalized on [our site here](https://www.pascalpdx.org/static/hacktoberfest2018.md) for years!
